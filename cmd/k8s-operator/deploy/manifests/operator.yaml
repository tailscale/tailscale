                    Connector defines a Tailscale node that will be deployed in the cluster. The

                    DNSConfig can be deployed to cluster to make a subset of Tailscale MagicDNS
                    names resolvable by cluster workloads. Use this if: A) you need to refer to
                    tailnet services, exposed to cluster via Tailscale Kubernetes operator egress
                    proxies by the MagicDNS names of those tailnet services (usually because the
                    services run over HTTPS)
                    B) you have exposed a cluster workload to the tailnet using Tailscale Ingress
                    and you also want to refer to the workload from within the cluster over the
                    Ingress's MagicDNS name (usually because you have some callback component
                    that needs to use the same URL as that used by a non-cluster client on
                    tailnet).
                    When a DNSConfig is applied to a cluster, Tailscale Kubernetes operator will
                    deploy a nameserver for ts.net DNS names and automatically populate it with records
                    for any Tailscale egress or Ingress proxies deployed to that cluster.
                    Currently you must manually update your cluster DNS configuration to add the
                    IP address of the deployed nameserver as a ts.net stub nameserver.
                    Instructions for how to do it:
                    https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#configuration-of-stub-domain-and-upstream-nameserver-using-coredns (for CoreDNS),
                    https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kube-dns (for kube-dns).
                    Tailscale Kubernetes operator will write the address of a Service fronting
                    the nameserver to dsnconfig.status.nameserver.ip.
                    DNSConfig is a singleton - you must not create more than one.
                    NB: if you want cluster workloads to be able to refer to Tailscale Ingress
                    using its MagicDNS name, you must also annotate the Ingress resource with
                    tailscale.com/experimental-forward-cluster-traffic-via-ingress annotation to
                    ensure that the proxy created for the Ingress listens on its Pod IP address.
                    NB: Clusters where Pods get assigned IPv6 addresses only are currently not supported.

                    ProxyClass describes a set of configuration parameters that can be applied to
                    proxy resources created by the Tailscale Kubernetes operator.
                    To apply a given ProxyClass to resources created for a tailscale Ingress or
                    Service, use tailscale.com/proxy-class=<proxyclass-name> label. To apply a
                    given ProxyClass to resources created for a Connector, use
                    connector.spec.proxyClass field.
                    ProxyClass is a cluster scoped resource.

                                                RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                                recursively.

                                                If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                                If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                                recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                                recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                                field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                                supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                                an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                                If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                                None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                                If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                                ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                                The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                                and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                                Use this if:
                                                a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                                b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                                   tracking are needed,
                                                c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                                d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                                   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                                   information on the connection between this volume type
                                                   and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                                Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                                APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                                of an individual pod.

                                                Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                                be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                                more information.

                                                A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                                persistent volumes at the same time.

                                                        Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                                        The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                                        owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                                        pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                                        `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                                        entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                                        is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                                        An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                                        will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                                        volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                                        the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                                        meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                                        owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                                        this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                                        manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                        to the PVC after it has been created.
