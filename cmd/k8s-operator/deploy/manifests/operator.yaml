                                    AppConnector defines whether the Connector device should act as a Tailscale app connector. A Connector that is
                                    configured as an app connector cannot be a subnet router or an exit node. If this field is unset, the
                                    Connector does not act as an app connector.
                                    Note that you will need to manually configure the permissions and the domains for the app connector via the
                                    Admin panel.
                                    Note also that the main tested and supported use case of this config option is to deploy an app connector on
                                    Kubernetes to access SaaS applications available on the public internet. Using the app connector to expose
                                    cluster workloads or other internal workloads to tailnet might work, but this is not a use case that we have
                                    tested or optimised for.
                                    If you are using the app connector to access SaaS applications because you need a predictable egress IP that
                                    can be whitelisted, it is also your responsibility to ensure that cluster traffic from the connector flows
                                    via that predictable IP, for example by enforcing that cluster egress traffic is routed via an egress NAT
                                    device with a static IP address.

                    DNSConfig can be deployed to cluster to make a subset of Tailscale MagicDNS
                    names resolvable by cluster workloads. Use this if: A) you need to refer to
                    tailnet services, exposed to cluster via Tailscale Kubernetes operator egress
                    proxies by the MagicDNS names of those tailnet services (usually because the
                    services run over HTTPS)
                    B) you have exposed a cluster workload to the tailnet using Tailscale Ingress
                    and you also want to refer to the workload from within the cluster over the
                    Ingress's MagicDNS name (usually because you have some callback component
                    that needs to use the same URL as that used by a non-cluster client on
                    tailnet).
                    When a DNSConfig is applied to a cluster, Tailscale Kubernetes operator will
                    deploy a nameserver for ts.net DNS names and automatically populate it with records
                    for any Tailscale egress or Ingress proxies deployed to that cluster.
                    Currently you must manually update your cluster DNS configuration to add the
                    IP address of the deployed nameserver as a ts.net stub nameserver.
                    Instructions for how to do it:
                    https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#configuration-of-stub-domain-and-upstream-nameserver-using-coredns (for CoreDNS),
                    https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kube-dns (for kube-dns).
                    Tailscale Kubernetes operator will write the address of a Service fronting
                    the nameserver to dsnconfig.status.nameserver.ip.
                    DNSConfig is a singleton - you must not create more than one.
                    NB: if you want cluster workloads to be able to refer to Tailscale Ingress
                    using its MagicDNS name, you must also annotate the Ingress resource with
                    tailscale.com/experimental-forward-cluster-traffic-via-ingress annotation to
                    ensure that the proxy created for the Ingress listens on its Pod IP address.
                    NB: Clusters where Pods get assigned IPv6 addresses only are currently not supported.
