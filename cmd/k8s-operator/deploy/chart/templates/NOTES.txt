You have successfully installed the Tailscale Kubernetes Operator!

Once connected, the operator should appear as a device within the Tailscale admin console:
https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines

If you have not used the Tailscale operator before, here are some examples to try out:

* Private Kubernetes API access and authorization using the API server proxy
  https://tailscale.com/kb/1437/kubernetes-operator-api-server-proxy

* Private access to cluster Services using an ingress proxy
  https://tailscale.com/kb/1439/kubernetes-operator-cluster-ingress

* Private access to the cluster's available subnets using a subnet router
  https://tailscale.com/kb/1441/kubernetes-operator-connector

You can also explore the CRDs, operator, and associated resources within the {{ .Release.Namespace }} namespace:

$ kubectl explain connector
$ kubectl explain proxygroup
$ kubectl explain proxyclass
$ kubectl explain recorder
$ kubectl explain dnsconfig

If you're interested to explore what resources were created:

$ kubectl --namespace={{ .Release.Namespace }} get all -l app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm
