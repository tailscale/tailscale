            DNSConfig can be deployed to cluster to make a subset of Tailscale MagicDNS
            names resolvable by cluster workloads. Use this if: A) you need to refer to
            tailnet services, exposed to cluster via Tailscale Kubernetes operator egress
            proxies by the MagicDNS names of those tailnet services (usually because the
            services run over HTTPS)
            B) you have exposed a cluster workload to the tailnet using Tailscale Ingress
            and you also want to refer to the workload from within the cluster over the
            Ingress's MagicDNS name (usually because you have some callback component
            that needs to use the same URL as that used by a non-cluster client on
            tailnet).
            When a DNSConfig is applied to a cluster, Tailscale Kubernetes operator will
            deploy a nameserver for ts.net DNS names and automatically populate it with records
            for any Tailscale egress or Ingress proxies deployed to that cluster.
            Currently you must manually update your cluster DNS configuration to add the
            IP address of the deployed nameserver as a ts.net stub nameserver.
            Instructions for how to do it:
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#configuration-of-stub-domain-and-upstream-nameserver-using-coredns (for CoreDNS),
            https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kube-dns (for kube-dns).
            Tailscale Kubernetes operator will write the address of a Service fronting
            the nameserver to dsnconfig.status.nameserver.ip.
            DNSConfig is a singleton - you must not create more than one.
            NB: if you want cluster workloads to be able to refer to Tailscale Ingress
            using its MagicDNS name, you must also annotate the Ingress resource with
            tailscale.com/experimental-forward-cluster-traffic-via-ingress annotation to
            ensure that the proxy created for the Ingress listens on its Pod IP address.
