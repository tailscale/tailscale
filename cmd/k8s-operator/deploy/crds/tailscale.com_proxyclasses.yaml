            ProxyClass describes a set of configuration parameters that can be applied to
            proxy resources created by the Tailscale Kubernetes operator.
            To apply a given ProxyClass to resources created for a tailscale Ingress or
            Service, use tailscale.com/proxy-class=<proxyclass-name> label. To apply a
            given ProxyClass to resources created for a Connector, use
            connector.spec.proxyClass field.
            ProxyClass is a cluster scoped resource.

                                You can reduce the permissions of the Tailscale container to cap NET_ADMIN by

                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                  between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                  The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                  or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                  In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                  - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                  scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                  violate MaxSkew(1).

                                  When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                  Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                  And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                  this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                  As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                  scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                  If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                  Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                  When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                  |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                  The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                  In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                  because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                  it will violate MaxSkew.

                                  TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                  and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                  We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                  of pods into each bucket.
                                  We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                  Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                  nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                  e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                                  And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                                  the spread constraint.
                                  - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                  - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                    but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                    skew.
                                  A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                  if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                  "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                  | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                  If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                  to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                  MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                  won't make it *more* imbalanced.
                                  It's a required field.
