            ProxyGroup defines a set of Tailscale devices that will act as proxies.
            Currently only egress ProxyGroups are supported.

            Use the tailscale.com/proxy-group annotation on a Service to specify that
            the egress proxy should be implemented by a ProxyGroup instead of a single
            dedicated proxy. In addition to running a highly available set of proxies,
            ProxyGroup also allows for serving many annotated Services from a single
            set of proxies to minimise resource consumption.
