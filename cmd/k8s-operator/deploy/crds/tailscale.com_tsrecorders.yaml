                          If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                          If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                          recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                          recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                          field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                          supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                          an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                          If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                          None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                          If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                        description: |-
                          ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                          The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                          and deleted when the pod is removed.

                          Use this if:
                          a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                          b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                             tracking are needed,
                          c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                          d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                             a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                             information on the connection between this volume type
                             and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                          Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                          APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                          of an individual pod.

                          Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                          be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                          more information.

                          A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                          persistent volumes at the same time.

                              Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                              The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                              owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                              pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                              `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                              entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                              is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                              An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                              will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                              volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                              the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                              meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                              owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                              this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                              manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                        specified.
                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                        in any namespaces.
                                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                    comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated.
                                    The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet
                                    may change the order over time.
