// Cache contains cached information about the last time this tool was run.
//
// This is serialized to a JSON file that should NOT be checked into git.
// It should be managed with either CI cache tools or stored locally somehow. The
// exact mechanism is irrelevant as long as it is consistent.
//
// This allows gitops-pusher to detect external ACL changes. I'm not sure what to
// call this problem, so I've been calling it the "three version problem" in my
// notes. The basic problem is that at any given time we only have two versions
// of the ACL file at any given point. In order to check if there has been
// tampering of the ACL files in the admin panel, we need to have a _third_ version
// to compare against.
//
// In this case I am not storing the old ACL entirely (though that could be a
// reasonable thing to add in the future), but only its sha256sum. This allows
// us to detect if the shasum in control matches the shasum we expect, and if that
// expectation fails, then we can react accordingly.
