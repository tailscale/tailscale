	//    (see the publicdns package) for which the IP addresses to dial DoH are
	//    known ahead of time, so bootstrap DNS resolution is not required.
	//  - "http://node-address:port/path" for DNS over HTTP over WireGuard. This
	//    is implemented in the PeerAPI for exit nodes and app connectors.
	//  - [TODO] "tls://resolver.com" for DNS over TCP+TLS
