## Reporting Incidents

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to Tailscale directly via <info@tailscale.com>, or to the community leaders or moderators via DM or similar.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
We will respect the privacy and safety of the reporter of any issues.

Please note that this community is not moderated by staff 24/7, and we do not have, and do not undertake, any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any content or data, or to actively seek facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity.
While we strive to keep the community safe and welcoming, moderation may not be immediate at all hours.
If you encounter any issues, report them using the appropriate channels.

## Enforcement

Community leaders and moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders and moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Community Code of Conduct.
Tailscale retains full discretion to take action (or not) in response to a violation of these guidelines with or without notice or liability to you.
We will interpret our policies and resolve disputes in favor of protecting users, customers, the public, our community and our company, as a whole.
