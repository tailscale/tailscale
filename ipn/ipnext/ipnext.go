// Host is the API surface used by [Extension]s to interact with LocalBackend
// in a controlled manner.
//
// Extensions can register callbacks, request information, or perform actions
// via the [Host] interface.
//
// Typically, the host invokes registered callbacks when one of the following occurs:
//   - LocalBackend notifies it of an event or state change that may be
//     of interest to extensions, such as when switching [ipn.LoginProfile].
//   - LocalBackend needs to consult extensions for information, for example,
//     determining the most appropriate profile for the current state of the system.
//   - LocalBackend performs an extensible action, such as logging an auditable event,
//     and delegates its execution to the extension.
//
// The callbacks are invoked synchronously, and the LocalBackend's state
// remains unchanged while callbacks execute.
//
// In contrast, actions initiated by extensions are generally asynchronous,
// as indicated by the "Async" suffix in their names.
// Performing actions may result in callbacks being invoked as described above.
//
// To prevent conflicts between extensions competing for shared state,
// such as the current profile or prefs, the host must not expose methods
// that directly modify that state. For example, instead of allowing extensions
// to switch profiles at-will, the host's [ProfileServices] provides a method
// to switch to the "best" profile. The host can then consult extensions
// to determine the appropriate profile to use and resolve any conflicts
// in a controlled manner.
//
