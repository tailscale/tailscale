# flake.nix describes a Nix source repository that provides
# development builds of Tailscale and the fork of the Go compiler
# toolchain that Tailscale maintains. It also provides a development
# environment for working on tailscale, for use with "nix develop".
#
# For more information about this and why this file is useful, see:
# https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes
#
# Also look into direnv: https://direnv.net/, this can make it so that you can
# automatically get your environment set up when you change folders into the
# project.
#
# WARNING: currently, the packages provided by this flake are brittle,
# and importing this flake into your own Nix configs is likely to
# leave you with broken builds periodically.
#
# The issue is that building Tailscale binaries uses the buildGoModule
# helper from nixpkgs. This helper demands to know the content hash of
# all of the Go dependencies of this repo, in the form of a Nix SRI
# hash. This hash isn't automatically kept in sync with changes made
# to go.mod yet, and so every time we update go.mod while hacking on
# Tailscale, this flake ends up with a broken build due to hash
# mismatches.
#
# Right now, this flake is intended for use by Tailscale developers,
# who are aware of this mismatch and willing to live with it. At some
# point, we'll add automation to keep the hashes more in sync, at
# which point this caveat should go away.
#
# See https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/6845 for tracking
# how to fix this mismatch.

    # This is currently unfortunately brittle, because we have to

    # go.mod. We don't want to force a nix dependency on everyone

    # builds periodically until someone comes through and manually
    # fixes them up. I sure wish there was a way to express "please
    # just trust the local go.mod, vendorHash has no benefit here",
    # but alas.
    #

    # you're an end user you should be prepared for this flake to not
