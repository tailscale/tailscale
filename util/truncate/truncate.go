package truncate

// String returns a prefix of a UTF-8 string s, having length no greater than n
// bytes. If s exceeds this length, it is truncated at a point â‰¤ n so that the
// result does not end in a partial UTF-8 encoding.  If s is less than or equal
// to this length, it is returned unmodified. If n is negative, s is also returned
// unmodified.

	for n > 0 && s[n-1]&0xc0 == 0x80 { // 0x10... is a continuation byte
		n--
	}

	// If we're at the beginning of a multi-byte encoding, back up one more to
	// skip it. It's possible the value was already complete, but it's simpler
	// if we only have to check in one direction.
	//
	// Otherwise, we have a single-byte code (0x00... or 0x01...).
	if n > 0 && s[n-1]&0xc0 == 0xc0 { // 0x11... starts a multibyte encoding
