// Package ssm provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for Amazon
// Simple Systems Manager (SSM).
//
// Amazon Web Services Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that helps
// you automate management tasks such as collecting system inventory, applying
// operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of Amazon Machine Images
// (AMIs), and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications at scale.
// Systems Manager lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your
// managed nodes. A managed node is any Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
// instance, edge device, or on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) that has
// been configured for Systems Manager. With support for IoT Greengrass Version 2
// devices, the phrase managed instance has been changed to managed node in most of
// the Systems Manager documentation. The Systems Manager console, API calls, error
// messages, and SSM documents still use the term instance. This reference is
// intended to be used with the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/). To get started,
// verify prerequisites and configure managed nodes. For more information, see
// Setting up Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up.html)
// in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. Related resources
