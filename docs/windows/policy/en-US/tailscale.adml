            <string id="LoginURL">Require using a specific Tailscale coordination server</string>
            <string id="LoginURL_Help"><![CDATA[This policy can be used to require the use of a particular Tailscale coordination server.

If you enable this policy, set it to the URL of your coordination server, beginning with https:// and ending with no trailing slash. If blank or "https://controlplane.tailscale.com", the default coordination server will be required.

If you disable or do not configure this policy, the Tailscale SaaS coordination server will be used by default, but a non-standard Tailscale coordination server can be configured using the CLI.

See https://tailscale.com/kb/1315/mdm-keys#set-a-custom-control-server-url for more details.]]></string>
            <string id="LogTarget">Require using a specific Tailscale log server</string>
            <string id="LogTarget_Help"><![CDATA[This policy can be used to require the use of a non-standard log server.
Please note that using a non-standard log server will limit Tailscale Support's ability to diagnose problems.

If you configure this policy, set it to the URL of your log server, beginning with https:// and ending with no trailing slash. If blank or "https://log.tailscale.com", the default log server will be used.

If you disable this policy, the Tailscale standard log server will be used by default, but a non-standard Tailscale log server can be configured using the TS_LOG_TARGET environment variable.]]></string>
            <string id="Tailnet">Specify which Tailnet should be used for Login</string>
            <string id="Tailnet_Help"><![CDATA[This policy can be used to suggest or require a specific tailnet when opening the login page.

To suggest a tailnet at login time, set this to the name of the tailnet, as shown in the top-left of the admin panel, such as "example.com". That tailnet's SSO button will be shown prominently, along with the option to select a different tailnet.

To require logging in to a particular tailnet, add the "required:" prefix, such as "required:example.com". The result is similar to the suggested tailnet but there will be no option to choose a different tailnet.

If you enable this policy, set it to the name of the tailnet, possibly with the "required:" prefix, as described above.

If you disable or do not configure this policy, the standard login page will be used.

See https://tailscale.com/kb/1315/mdm-keys#set-a-suggested-or-required-tailnet for more details.]]></string>
            <string id="AuthKey">Specify the auth key to authenticate devices without user interaction</string>
            <string id="AuthKey_Help"><![CDATA[This policy allows specifying the default auth key to be used when registering new devices without requiring sign-in via a web browser, unless the user specifies a different auth key via the CLI.

Managing authentication keys via Group Policy and MDM solutions poses significant security risks. Group Policy is not designed to store and deploy secrets, and by default, Group Policy settings can be read by all domain-authenticated users and devices, regardless of their privilege level or whether the policy setting applies to them.

While MDM solutions tend to offer better control over who can access the policy setting values, they can still be compromised. Additionally, with both Group Policy and MDM solutions, the auth key is always readable by all users who have access to the device where this policy setting applies, as well as by all applications running on the device. A compromised auth key can potentially be used by a malicious actor to gain or elevate access to the target network.

Only consider this option after carefully reviewing the organization's security posture. For example, ensure you configure the auth keys specifically for the tag of the device and that access control policies only grant necessary access between the tailnet and the tagged device. Additionally, consider using short-lived auth keys, one-time auth keys (with one GPO/MDM configuration per device), Device Approval, and/or Tailnet lock to minimize risk. If you suspect an auth key has been compromised, revoke the auth key immediately.

If you enable this policy setting and specify an auth key, it will be used to authenticate the device unless the device is already logged in or an auth key is explicitly specified via the CLI.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, an interactive user login will be required..

See https://tailscale.com/kb/1315/mdm-keys#set-an-auth-key for more details.]]></string>
            <string id="ExitNodeID">Require using a specific Exit Node</string>
            <string id="ExitNodeID_Help"><![CDATA[This policy can be used to require always using the specified Exit Node whenever the Tailscale client is connected.
    
If you enable this policy, set it to the ID of an exit node. The ID is visible on the Machines page of the admin console, or can be queried using the Tailscale API. If the specified exit node is unavailable, this device will have no Internet access unless Tailscale is disconnected. Alternatively, you can set it to "auto:any" (without quotes), which allows the Tailscale client to automatically select the most suitable exit node.

If you disable this policy or supply an empty exit node ID, then usage of exit nodes will be disallowed.

If you do not configure this policy, no exit node will be used by default but an exit node (if one is available and permitted by ACLs) can be chosen by the user if desired.

See https://tailscale.com/kb/1315/mdm-keys#force-an-exit-node-to-always-be-used and https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes for more details.]]></string>
            <string id="AllowedSuggestedExitNodes">Limit automated Exit Node suggestions to specific nodes</string>
            <string id="AllowedSuggestedExitNodes_Help"><![CDATA[This policy setting allows configuring a pool of exit nodes from which the Tailscale client will automatically select the most suitable suggested exit node when required. The suggested exit node is displayed in the GUI and CLI and is automatically selected and enforced when the "Require using a specific Exit Node" policy setting is enabled and set to "auto:any".

If you enable this policy setting, suggestions will be limited to exit nodes with the specified IDs. The IDs are visible on the Machines page of the admin console, or can be queried using the Tailscale API.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, no limitations will apply, and all available exit nodes will be considered when selecting the most suitable suggested node.
