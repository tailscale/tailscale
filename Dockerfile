# WARNING: Tailscale is not yet officially supported in Docker,
# Kubernetes, etc.

# It might work, but we don't regularly test it, and it's not as polished as
# our currently supported platforms. This is provided for people who know
# how Tailscale works and what they're doing.

#    https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/504
